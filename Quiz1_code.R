#Each row is a nest.
#Nests were put into one of two treatments: simulated predation (predator), or control (control).
##Along with treatment you have the following columns:nest_fate = whether the nest fledged any young or whether they all died,
#brood = number of nestlings, n_fledged = number of nestlings that fledged
#Create a new column called prop_fledged that contains the proportion of nestlings that fledged from each nest.
###so i need n_fledged/brood ?? because I do not see a nest_fate column that is data from swallow_nestlings.csv

updated_swallows$prop_fledged <- updated_swallows$n_fledged / updated_swallows$brood

###The %>% is called piping. The pipe operator takes the output of one function and passes it as the first argument to the next function. This allows you to string together multiple operations in a clear, linear fashion.
